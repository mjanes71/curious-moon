# Curious Moon
I'm working through curious moon to upskill on database internals, psql, and data engineering best practices. 

## Where I left off:
* The Makefile runs! `make` will run the makefile and `make clean` will destroy the evidence. Lol. 

The make file creates a build file that executes all necessary steps to create a master_plan table with data in it from `data\master_plan.csv`

`make clean` deletes the build file that is created by running make.

Ready for the next section- **normalization.** The normalization file is currently empty but that doesn't affect the current build process.
